The updated password generator was updated with changes to the htlm, css, and javascript files.

## Instructions were to create a Random Password Generator using the skills that we learned in the pervious weeks.

### Given the password generator, a random user needing to generate a more secure password would be able to use this application to generate random passwords
unfamilar to themselves, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to a specified account, device, etc...

#### To generate a random password, user must open the applicationn and click the button that is labeled generate passoword.

##### The generated password would then be displayed in the input widonw labelled your secure password.
